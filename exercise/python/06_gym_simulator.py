Exercise 6: Complete Gym Simulator

This is it - the culmination of everything you've learned! You'll build a complete
gym simulator that brings together variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes,
and now FILE I/O to save and load data. This is a real-world application!

Concepts covered:
- File I/O (reading and writing files)
- JSON format (saving structured data)
- Error handling (try/except blocks)
- Bringing together all previous concepts
- Building a complete application

Learning Goals:
- Save and load data from files
- Handle errors gracefully
- Build a multi-class system
- Create a complete, working simulation
- See how all Python concepts work together

# ============================================================================
# QUICK INTRO: File I/O and JSON
# ============================================================================
# Until now, when your program ends, all data disappears. File I/O lets you
# save data to disk and load it back later!
#
# JSON is a popular format for storing structured data (lists, dictionaries).
# It's like a text version of Python data structures.
#
# Key operations:
# - json.dump(data, file) - saves data to a file
# - json.load(file) - reads data from a file
# - try/except - handles errors (like file not found)

# YOUR TURN: TODO EXERCISES
# ============================================================================

print("\n\n=== YOUR GYM SIMULATOR ===\n")

# TODO 1: Create your own gym
# Create a Gym object with your chosen gym name
# Store it in a variable called your_gym
#
# Stuck? Ask: "How do I create an object from a class?"

# Write your code here:




# TODO 2: Add yourself as a member
# Use the add_member method to add yourself to the gym
# Store your member ID in a variable called my_member_id
#
# Then get your member object using get_member() and store it in my_member
#
# Need help? Ask: "How do I call a method on an object and store the result?"

# Write your code here:




# TODO 3: Log three different workouts
# Log three workouts for yourself using the log_workout method:
# 1. Bench Press: 3 sets, 10 reps, 135 lbs
# 2. Squats: 4 sets, 8 reps, 185 lbs
# 3. Pull-ups: 3 sets, 12 reps, 0 lbs (bodyweight)
#
# HINT: Call my_member.log_workout() three times
#
# Stuck? Ask: "How do I call a method multiple times with different parameters?"

# Write your code here:





# TODO 4: Add another member and log their workout
# Add a friend or workout partner to your gym
# Log at least one workout for them
#
# Need help? Ask: "Show me the pattern for adding a member and logging workouts"

# Write your code here:





# TODO 5: Print summaries of all members
# Loop through all members in your_gym.members and print their summary
#
# HINT: Use .values() to loop through the member objects
# HINT: Call the get_summary() method on each member
#
# Stuck? Ask: "How do I loop through dictionary values and call methods?"

# Write your code here:




# TODO 6: Save your gym data
# Save your gym data to a file called "my_gym_data.json"
# Use the save_to_file method
#
# After running this, check that the file was created in your exercise folder!
#
# Need help? Ask: "How do I call the save_to_file method?"

# Write your code here:




# TODO 7: Test loading data (Optional - requires running twice)
# Comment out TODOs 1-6 above, then create a new empty gym
# and try loading from "my_gym_data.json" using load_from_file()
# This demonstrates data persistence!
#
# Want to see it work? Ask: "How do I test loading saved data?"

# Write your code here:




# ============================================================================
# BONUS CHALLENGES (Optional)
# ============================================================================

# BONUS 1: Create an Equipment class
# Create a class to track gym equipment (like in Exercise 5)
# Add it to the Gym class as a dictionary of equipment
# Save and load equipment data in the JSON file
#
# For help: Ask "How do I add a new class and integrate it with existing code?"

# Write your code here:




# BONUS 2: Add workout statistics
# Add a method to GymMember called get_workout_stats() that returns:
# - Total workouts logged
# - Average volume per workout
# - Most common exercise
# - Total weight lifted (sum of all volume)
#
# Want guidance? Ask: "How do I calculate statistics from a list of dictionaries?"

# Write your code here:




# BONUS 3: Create a simple menu system
# Create a function called run_gym_menu() that:
# 1. Displays a menu of options (add member, log workout, view stats, save, quit)
# 2. Takes user input
# 3. Performs the chosen action
# 4. Loops until user chooses quit
#
# This is advanced! Ask: "How do I create an interactive menu in Python?"
# HINT: Use input() to get user choices, and a while loop to keep running

# Write your code here:




# ============================================================================
# TESTING YOUR CODE
# ============================================================================

# After completing the TODOs, you should have:
# - A gym with at least 2 members
# - Multiple workouts logged
# - Summaries printed showing visits and total volume
# - A "my_gym_data.json" file created (check your exercise folder!)
#
# To verify the file:
# 1. Look for my_gym_data.json in the exercise/python folder
# 2. Open it in your editor - it should be readable JSON
# 3. Try loading it back by running TODO 7
#
# Congratulations! You've built a complete application that:
# - Uses classes and objects
# - Manages complex data
# - Saves and loads from files
# - Handles errors gracefully
