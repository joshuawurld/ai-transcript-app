Architecture Review - API Framework Selection

Sarah: Thanks for joining everyone. Today we need to make a final decision on our API architecture for the new platform. We've been evaluating options for the past two weeks, and it's time to commit to a direction.

Alex: Right. So we've narrowed it down to two options: GraphQL or REST. I've been researching both extensively.

Mike: I've been leaning toward GraphQL because of the flexibility it gives frontend teams. We can request exactly the data we need without over-fetching.

Jordan: I see the appeal, but I'm concerned about the learning curve. Our team has years of REST experience, and GraphQL would require significant ramp-up time.

Alex: That's a valid point. Let me lay out what I found:

For GraphQL:
- Pros: Flexible queries, strong typing, single endpoint, great developer experience
- Cons: More complex caching, harder to monitor, learning curve for the team, limited tooling maturity

For REST:
- Pros: Team already knows it well, mature ecosystem, simple caching with HTTP, easy to monitor and debug
- Cons: Over-fetching data, multiple endpoints, versioning can be messy

Sarah: What about performance? That's critical for us.

Alex: Both can be performant if implemented well. GraphQL can reduce network requests with batching, but REST is simpler to cache at the CDN level. For our scale, either would work.

Emma: From a frontend perspective, GraphQL would make our lives easier long-term, but Jordan's right about the learning curve.

Mike: What if we consider our timeline? We need to ship the new platform in Q1.

Jordan: Exactly. With REST, we can move fast because we know the patterns. GraphQL would slow us down initially even though it might be better long-term.

Sarah: That's a crucial consideration. We're prioritizing time-to-market for this launch.

Alex: Given our constraints - team expertise, timeline pressure, and need for reliability - I think REST is the pragmatic choice. We can always evaluate GraphQL for future iterations once we've shipped v1.

Sarah: I agree. The risk is lower with REST, and we need to de-risk this launch as much as possible.

Emma: Makes sense. I can work with REST, and we can design the endpoints thoughtfully to minimize over-fetching.

Jordan: I'm on board. Let's go with REST.

Mike: Agreed.

Sarah: Alright, decision made: We're using REST for the API framework.

Let's document the rationale clearly so future teams understand why we made this choice. The key factors were:
1. Team expertise and velocity
2. Timeline constraints for Q1 launch
3. Lower risk with mature, well-understood technology
4. Easier monitoring and debugging

We can revisit GraphQL for v2 or other services once this platform is stable.

Everyone good with that?

All: Yes, sounds good.

Sarah: Great. I'll update the architecture docs with this decision. Thanks everyone for the thoughtful discussion.
