Project Planning Meeting - New Feature Implementation

Sarah: Alright team, let's plan out the new user dashboard feature. We need to break this down into concrete tasks.

Mike: I can take the frontend work. I'll build the React components and integrate with the API.

Sarah: Great. How long do you think that will take?

Mike: Should be done by end of week, maybe Friday.

Sarah: Perfect. And we'll need the backend API endpoints first. Alex, can you handle that?

Alex: Yeah, I'll create the REST API for user stats and activity data. I can have it ready by Wednesday.

Sarah: Excellent. That gives Mike time to integrate. We also need database migrations. Jordan, you're on that?

Jordan: Yep, I'll set up the new tables for storing user activity logs. I can get that done by tomorrow actually.

Sarah: Amazing. And finally, we need comprehensive tests. Mike, can you write unit tests for the frontend components?

Mike: Absolutely, I'll add those as I go.

Alex: I'll write integration tests for the API endpoints too.

Sarah: Perfect. Let me summarize the action items:
- Jordan: Create database migrations - due tomorrow
- Alex: Build REST API endpoints - due Wednesday
- Mike: Build React dashboard components - due Friday
- Mike: Write frontend unit tests - due Friday
- Alex: Write API integration tests - due Wednesday

Everyone good with these deadlines?

All: Sounds good!

Sarah: Great, let's reconvene on Friday to review everything. Meeting adjourned.
