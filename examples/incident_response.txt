URGENT - Production Incident Response Call

Sarah: Everyone, we have a critical production issue. Our payment processing is completely down. Customers can't complete purchases.

Alex: I'm seeing errors in the logs. It looks like the payment gateway is returning 500 errors on all requests.

Mike: How long has this been happening?

Sarah: We started getting alerts about 15 minutes ago. This is affecting ALL transactions, so revenue is completely stopped.

Jordan: I'm checking our dashboard - we've had about 200 failed payment attempts in the last 10 minutes. This is really bad.

Alex: The payment gateway API is responding but rejecting all our requests. Looking at the error message... oh no, our API credentials expired today!

Sarah: What?! How did we not know about this?

Alex: There should have been renewal reminders but they might have gone to the old team email alias that no one monitors anymore.

Sarah: Okay, we need to fix this immediately. Alex, can you regenerate new credentials?

Alex: Yes, but I need approval from our payment provider first. Let me contact their emergency support line right now.

Sarah: Do it. Mike, prepare a deployment with the new credentials as soon as Alex gets them. How quickly can you deploy?

Mike: I can have a hotfix branch ready in 5 minutes. Once we have new credentials, I can deploy to production in under 10 minutes.

Sarah: Good. Jordan, start drafting an incident report. We'll need to communicate this to leadership and potentially affected customers.

Jordan: On it. Should I also check if we need to refund any failed transactions?

Sarah: Yes, good thinking. Get a count of all failed payments in the last hour.

Alex: I'm on hold with payment support now... Okay, they're expediting the credential renewal. Should have new keys in about 10 minutes.

Sarah: The moment you get those keys, send them to Mike immediately. This is our top priority. Everything else stops until payments are working again.

Everyone: Understood.

Sarah: I'm notifying the CEO and VP of Engineering now. Stand by for updates.
